## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to, when retrying this page, do a 'Thank you' message for the submit. But for now I did just this small validation like a speed-run exercise.

### Useful resources

- [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - This helped me for the Regular Expression match I've done. The most voted pattern is the one I used.
